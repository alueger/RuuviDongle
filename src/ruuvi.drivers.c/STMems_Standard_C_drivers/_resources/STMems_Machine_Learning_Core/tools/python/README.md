## 1 - Python scripts

This folder contains some scripts to be used as example for generating a decision tree with Python, through the *scikit* package. 
The scripts are available both as Jupyter notebook (*.ipynb*) and as common Python scripts (*.py*).
The example shows how to generate a decision tree file (*dectree.txt*) starting from an ARFF file (*test.arff*).
