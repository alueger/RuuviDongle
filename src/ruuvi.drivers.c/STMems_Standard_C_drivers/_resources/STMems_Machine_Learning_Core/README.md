## 1 - Introduction

This repository is intended to provide information on the **Machine Learning Core** feature available in some [**MEMS sensors**](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors.html?sc=MEMS).

Machine Learning processing allows moving some algorithms from the application processor to the *STMicroelectronics* sensor, enabling consistent reduction of power consumption.

Machine Learning processing is obtained through *decision-tree logic*. A decision tree is a mathematical tool composed of a series of configurable *nodes*. Each *node* is characterized by an *“if-then-else”* condition, where an input signal (represented by statistical parameters calculated from the sensor data) is evaluated against a threshold.

The results of the decision tree can be read from the application processor at any time. Furthermore, there is the possibility to **generate an interrupt** for every change in the result in the decision tree.


## 2 - Repository folder structure

This repository contains different folders which identify sensor part numbers supporting the **Machine Learning Core** feature.

Each folder related to the sensor part number contains sub-folders with examples of **Machine Learning Core** configurations. See a typical path below:

````Path
\lsm6dsox\Vibration monitoring\
````

The folder `tools` contains some additional scripts for decision tree generation.

## 3 - Example sub-folder file description 

Each example sub-folder contains:

- a `xxxxxxx.ucf` file, where  `xxxxxxx` identifies the example. The `.ucf` file is the standard format for **Unico GUI**, which allows device configuration. *Unico GUI* is available for: [Windows](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109w.html), [Linux](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109l.html>), [Mac OS X](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109m.html>).

- a `xxxxxxx.h` file, where  `xxxxxxx` identifies the example. This file is a *C programming language header* and can be generated by *Unico GUI*.

  Some examples of  `xxxxxxx.h` file integration are available at [platform independent drivers repository]( http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/drivers-for-mems/c-driver-mems.html ) for *STMicroelectronics* sensors.

- README.md: additional info about the specific example.


## 4 - Required properties

For using *C header* files (`.h`):

> * A standard C language compiler for the target MCU
> * A C library for the target MCU and the desired interface (ie. SPI, I2C)

For using *Unico GUI* Configuration Files (`.ucf`):

> * Unico GUI for device configuration


## 5 - Examples

The examples can be used with:

- **Unico GUI** (available for: [Windows](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109w.html), [Linux](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109l.html>), [Mac OS X](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/evaluation-tool-software/stsw-mki109m.html>)) and  [Professional MEMS Tool board](<https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mems-motion-sensor-eval-boards/steval-mki109v3.html#overview>) (STEVAL-MKI109V3)
  - Run *Unico GUI* selecting the desired device, then go to the *Load/Save* tab, and load the *Unico GUI* Configuration File (`.ucf`)
- Any *C-programmable* hardware
  - Include the C header file (`.h`) in the desired project
  - Use the desired interface C library for the target *MCU* for writing the array configuration contained in the *C header* file (`.h`)
  - Some examples of integration are available at [platform independent drivers repository]( http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mems-and-sensors-software/drivers-for-mems/c-driver-mems.html ) for *STMicroelectronics* sensors.
